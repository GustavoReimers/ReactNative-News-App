HackerWeb for iOS
===

A simply readable Hacker News app for iOS.

Story
---

On June 2011, I [made a statement](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/82464262156587008).

On October 2011, I [was playing around with some code](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/125548998118490112).

On Feb 2012, I [released HackerWeb](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/170127822818516993) (known as "HNmobile" at that time). I tried to coin the phrase "**Looks *and* feels like a native iOS app**" for the web app. I believe that HackerWeb is the first ever web app that tries to **seriously** cross the boundaries of native mobile apps.

On March 2012, I [wrote](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/176294093259948033) an [article on how I built it](http://cheeaun.com/blog/2012/03/how-i-built-hacker-news-mobile-web-app). It [got submitted](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/176301483866865664) to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3662709) and [appeared on the front page](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/176308046493003776).

Okay fine, I'll stop now.

Time goes by as I continue improving the app bit by bit. Since it's a web app, it auto-updates itself *quietly* and doesn't need uh... much announcements.

- On 26 March 2012, I wrote [a second article](https://cheeaun.com/blog/2012/03/how-i-built-hacker-news-mobile-web-app_26).
- On 2 June 2012, I made it [work for the iPad](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/208902768830853120).
- Around September 2012, I [updated the UI for iOS 6](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/249455647458988032).
- On 12 Dec 2012, I [renamed the app to HackerWeb](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/278876187634327553).
- On 21 January 2013, I [gave a talk](https://github.com/cheeaun/talks/tree/master/things-learnt-hackerweb).
- On 21 December 2013, I [updated the UI again for iOS 7](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/414423892707401728).

Okay I lied, more tweet reviews:

Ever since HackerWeb is launched, there's been a few relevant articles and JS libraries popping up on the Internet:

...and probably a few more which I've missed.

Obviously I'm quite obsessed with "native". When [React Native is announced on January 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVZ-P-ZI6W4), I was excited and a little sceptical. I tried it and wasn't satisfied with it. After [attending ReactEurope](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/596304731166744576) on July 2015, I become inspired again to try React Native and finally [this project comes alive](https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/621679246944043008).

My previous attempt is to make a web app to look and feel like a native app. Now I have make a native app to look and feel like the web app!

So this is it. HackerWeb for iOS. Since 2011.

Development
---

### Requirements

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 4.0
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) 7
- [iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/) **9**

### Getting started

- `npm install` - Install all dependencies

### Implementations

- [Alt](http://alt.js.org/) - the Flux thing
- [react-native-safari-view](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-safari-view) - the reason why iOS 9 is the minimum requirement
- [react-native-activity-view](https://github.com/naoufal/react-native-activity-view) - for sharing links after long pressing
- [react-native-app-info](https://github.com/Iragne/react-native-app-info) - for displaying app version
- [htmlparser2](https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2) - for parsing the comments HTML
- [url-parse](https://github.com/unshiftio/url-parse) - for extracting domains out of story URLs

### Bundling standalone modules

Some `npm` modules don't work with React Native so I have to compile them into a standalone module. Here's an example of the steps to bundle `htmlparser2`:

1. `npm install -g browserify` if not installed
2. `git clone https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2`
3. `cd htmlparser2`
4. `npm install`
5. `browserify lib/index.js --standalone htmlparser2 > htmlparser2.js`
6. Move the generated `htmlparser2.js` file to the `vendor` folder in this repo

### Running on device (iOS)

This article has good documentation on this: [Running On Device (iOS)](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device-ios.html).

### Components

- `LoadingIndicator` - inspired by [react-native-activity-indicator-ios](https://github.com/pwmckenna/react-native-activity-indicator-ios)
- `HTMLView` - inspired by [react-native-htmlview](https://github.com/jsdf/react-native-htmlview), [react-native-htmltext](https://github.com/siuying/react-native-htmltext) and [react-native-html-render](https://github.com/soliury/react-native-html-render)
- `CacheStore` - inspired by [lscache](https://github.com/pamelafox/lscache)
